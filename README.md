**A Research-Oriented Multi-Agent Simulation Prototype Built in Godot**

This project is an experimental **persistent virtual world** designed to explore how autonomous agents (NPCs) can exhibit adaptive, goal-driven, and emergent behaviors inside a simulated environment.  
The project supports my long-term research direction in **multi-agent systems**, **game AI**, and **simulation-based behavior modeling** for future PhD studies.

## 🎯 1. Overview

**AI-Persistent-Virtual-World** is a sandbox environment where multiple agents operate independently based on:
- their internal needs (hunger, energy, social),
- real-time perception of the world,
- decision-making algorithms (FSM / Utility AI), and
- interaction with other agents and environmental objects.

The world is **persistent**, meaning agents continuously act, update state, and adapt over time—creating a miniature ecosystem for observing AI behavior.

## 🧠 2. Research Motivation

This prototype functions as a small-scale research environment to investigate:

**Agent behavior modeling**  
  How rule-based, utility-driven, or learning-based systems lead to different patterns of behavior.

**Emergent multi-agent dynamics**  
  Competition, cooperation, avoidance, crowd behavior, or resource-driven interaction.

**Environment influence**  
  How world layout, resource placement, or constraints shape agent decisions.

**AI in simulation/game contexts**  
  Demonstrating technical depth relevant to intelligent NPCs and game/simulation research in a PhD application.

This project is **not only a game demo**—it is a **research testbed**.
